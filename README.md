# Design Patterns for Parser Combinators
Welcome to the home for the _talk_ of our 2021 Haskell Symposium paper:
[Design Patterns for Parser Combinators](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3471874.3472984).

## What is the paper about?
This paper is about identifying and documenting design patterns that help to
organise and abstract parsers written in the parser combinator style. In particular,
in this repo we will use a parsec-style library called `miniparsec`, contained
within. In particular, this talk will cover the majority of sections 2 and 3 from the
paper. As time goes on, we may extend this repo to cover more topics.

## What is the future of this repo?
Aside from just being the home of the talk, I'd like this to be a place where we can
collect our common knowledge, via the discussions and possibly even more examples outside of the mocked one used in the talk.

Without further ado: time to exit the meta...
